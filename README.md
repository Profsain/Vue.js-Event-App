# Vue.js-Event-App
Vue.js Event list application demo 
I face some challenges while creating this app following Ryan Chenkie vue.js tutoria

MY array data in fetchEvent method is not loading to the Event list DOM Element

I tried to use v-repeat and v-for to loop through the array and set it to the DOM element but not working

It seems I'm missing something in my code

Kindly help me resolve it

I'm just a beginner in javascript programming

Warm regards....................
